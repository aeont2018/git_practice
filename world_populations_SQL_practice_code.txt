-- This is the first query:

SELECT DISTINCT year from population_years;

-- Add your additional queries below:

SELECT MAX(population)
FROM population_years
WHERE country = 'Gabon';

SELECT country, population
FROM population_years
WHERE year = 2005
ORDER BY population ASC
LIMIT 10;

SELECT DISTINCT country, population
from population_years
WHERE year = 2010 AND 
  population > 100;

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT country)
FROM population_years
WHERE country LIKE '%Islands%';

SELECT population
FROM population_years
WHERE year = 2000 AND country = 'Indonesia';

SELECT population
FROM population_years
WHERE year = 2010 AND country = 'Indonesia';

SELECT (242.96834 - 214.67661);


ALTERNATIVE WITHOUT DOING MATH FIRST:

–8. What is the difference in population between 2000 and 2010 in Indonesia?
SELECT (population - (SELECT population FROM population_years WHERE country = ‘Indonesia’ AND year = 2000))
FROM population_years 
WHERE country = ‘Indonesia’ and year = 2010;
